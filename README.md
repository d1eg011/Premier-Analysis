# Premier-Analysis
This project extracts data from Biwenger (Premier League fantasy football) and use it for machine learning purposes. The goal is to study player performance trends, pricing behavior, and position-based patterns with real-world fantasy football data.

**Daily updates with new data are scheduled at 00:03 (UTC-6)**

## Current Features

**Daily_Data**: csv's containing the data of the day indicated in each file.

**all_data.csv**: csv containing all the data of all dates available (Date column added).

**Automatic_Download**: folder containing the scripts for downloading automatically csv's from Biwenger. 

I have to be honest: I kind of forgot of this project for a few months. It stopped working for a reason still unknown (probably a new pop-up in the Biwenger web-page). It should be running with no errors from now on. I'll be paying attention to any new problems with the automatic update, I promise :).
